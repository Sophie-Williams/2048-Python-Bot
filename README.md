# 2048-Python-Bot
My attempt at playing 2048 with a bot written in Python. Uses screen grabbing to determine the game state and a basic tree search to calculate moves. 

Currently reaches 2048 a little under 50% of the time.

Screen grabbing code is taken from this excellent example, and you'll have to calculate the game coordinates to match your screen size!
